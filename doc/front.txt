You are a Principal Frontend Architect tasked with delivering a world-class mobile-first frontend for a Fortune 500‚Äìgrade product. The stack is:
‚Ä¢	HTML5 (semantic, accessible markup)
‚Ä¢	Bootstrap 5 (for responsive grid & utilities, no redundancy)
‚Ä¢	Tailwind CSS (for design precision, utility-first optimizations, mobile responsiveness, dark mode support)
‚Ä¢	Vercel Deployment (edge-optimized hosting, production-ready build)
‚Ä¢	Real Backend Integration (fetch real APIs, no placeholders/mock data) based on my backend/app.py file
üèÜ Non-Negotiable Requirements
1.	Performance Excellence ‚Ä¢ Lighthouse performance score ‚â• 95 on mobile. ‚Ä¢ Use critical CSS extraction + lazy loading + responsive images. ‚Ä¢ Implement instant-loading UX with preloading & API prefetching. ‚Ä¢ Enable HTTP/2 push hints or rel=preload for fonts, hero images, and above-the-fold content. ‚Ä¢ JS must be minimal and non-blocking (defer/async).
2.	SEO & Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) Standard SEO: ‚Ä¢ Semantic HTML5 structure (header, nav, main, footer, article, section). ‚Ä¢ <meta> tags: title, description, viewport, structured data (JSON-LD schema.org). ‚Ä¢ Open Graph + Twitter Cards for social previews. ‚Ä¢ ARIA roles + keyboard navigation support. ‚Ä¢ Mobile viewport scaling: viewport-fit=cover. Advanced SEO (YouTube/Google-level search visibility): ‚Ä¢ Target high-intent keywords: "Download YouTube videos online," "Free YouTube video downloader," "4K video downloader," "Direct YouTube video download." ‚Ä¢ Use keyword-rich titles, meta descriptions, headings (H1-H3), and naturally embed LSI keywords. ‚Ä¢ Implement JSON-LD VideoObject structured data for each downloadable video: include author, uploadDate, duration, thumbnailUrl, contentUrl. ‚Ä¢ Breadcrumb structured data for better SERP display. ‚Ä¢ Clean, extensionless URLs: /download, /4k-videos, /free-youtube-downloader. ‚Ä¢ Canonical tags to prevent duplicate content. ‚Ä¢ Sitemap.xml auto-updated with video pages; robots.txt optimized. ‚Ä¢ Pre-render key pages for search bots; backend/app.py must provide real video metadata. ‚Ä¢ Rich meta descriptions, thumbnails, star ratings, download counts, and video durations to enhance CTR in SERPs. ‚Ä¢ Analytics.js integration to track engagement, bounce rate, and optimize ranking signals.
3.	Preloaders / Data Loading ‚Ä¢ No placeholders; all content must come directly from backend/app.py in real time. ‚Ä¢ For heavy content, use skeleton screens (fade-in shimmer) or progressive blurred previews (LQIP), never static mock data. ‚Ä¢ Inline critical loader for the hero section (non-blocking, dynamically populated).
4.	Scalability & Real Backend Integration ‚Ä¢ Fetch real backend data from provided APIs. ‚Ä¢ Implement API caching, retries, error states, and graceful fallback UIs. ‚Ä¢ Ensure global i18n readiness (RTL, UTF-8, multilingual SEO).
5.	Mobile UX Enhancements ‚Ä¢ Topbar navigation (adaptive, collapsible, fixed). ‚Ä¢ Smooth gesture-friendly transitions.
6.	Theme Support: Light / Dark Mode ‚Ä¢ User-controlled toggle in the topbar to switch between light and dark themes. ‚Ä¢ Persist user preference in localStorage; default respects system-level preference (prefers-color-scheme). ‚Ä¢ Use Tailwind CSS dark mode classes (dark: variants) for minimal duplication. ‚Ä¢ All UI components, preloader skeletons, and real-time API content adapt automatically. ‚Ä¢ Maintain WCAG AA contrast ratios in both themes. ‚Ä¢ theme.js handles toggle, persistence, and class management on <html> or <body>.
7.	Deployment & Production Standards ‚Ä¢ Must deploy seamlessly to Vercel with zero config conflicts. ‚Ä¢ Avoid framework bloat (no React/Vue unless explicitly required). ‚Ä¢ Clean file structure: /index.html, /assets/, /css/, /js/, /api/. ‚Ä¢ Strictly no unused CSS/JS (purge Tailwind, tree-shake Bootstrap).
